Also a congestion charge would only start to make sense if public transportation were up to scratch, i.e. more than one bus an hour  coming from Portmarnock/Malahide (if the bus actually went all the way to Howth, which it currently does not), and different DART frequences (which would not help visitors who do not live on the Howth branch anyway). Also sone park+ride facility would be required, but there's no room for this in Sutton.
