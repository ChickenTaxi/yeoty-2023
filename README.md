# Driving Change: The Potential for Congestion Pricing in Irish Cities

This repository looks into the potential of congestion pricing in Irish cities, and it holds all of the data we have gathered ourselves, both through manual car counts and surveys.

## Usage

To run the analysis, you will need to install the following packages:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

To install those packages, you can use the command `pip3 install <package name>`.

To run the program itself you need to have a recent version of [python](https://www.python.org/) and run the following command in your terminal:

```
python3 analysis.py
```

<!-- The main script, `analysis.py` returns a graph showing the elasticity of congestion pricing in Howth, based on both survey data and car counts.

It also calculates various correlations between data points, which we reference in our paper. -->
